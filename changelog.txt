v0.1.1			23/03/2024			Just a simple block of code and trying if spaCy and python works.
v0.1.2			23/03/2024			Started an idea about how should T.R.I.M.S work.
v0.1.3			23/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S found all files in the same directory as the code and it should have written them out (there were 0 files).
v0.1.4			23/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S tried finding all files in C:\\ and wrote out all filenames.
v0.1.5			23/03/2024			Since T.R.I.M.S wrote out all the files it found (nearly 400000), got the idea to just show how many of these files are in this computer.
v0.1.6			23/03/2024			First stable version. T.R.I.M.S didnt write out all files and just showed the amount of these files. 

v0.2			23/03/2024			Improving the file searching capabilities. 
v0.2.1			23/03/2024			Reducing the number of files showing in T.R.I.M.S. Reducing by hidden files, directories (folders windows, program files, program files (x86), programdata) and system file types (removing dll, sys and exe files) . Amount of files got from 400000 to nearly 76000 files.

v0.3			24/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S asks user to write the directory to search from and gives user the amount of files it found. Then T.R.I.M.S asks if I want to it to write out all files in a separate textfile.
v0.3.1			24/03/2024			T.R.I.M.S found this time only 1200 files and it's a big improvement. Added .exe files to the search management (now it can show .exe files). Removed Appdata folder from search (it won't show it anymore).
v0.3.2			24/03/2024			Reduced files a little by removing .ini files (system files). Keep in mind to empty recycle bin in a while.
v0.3.3			24/03/2024			Tried to reduce by removing whole default folder, but it went wrong. (Unstable).
v0.3.4			24/03/2024			Fixed some problems with v0.3.3. (Stable version and file amount reduced to 700).
v0.3.5			24/03/2024			Removed Searches folder.

v0.4			24/03/2024			Removed .igpi and .dat file types. Management is done and it is next stable version.
